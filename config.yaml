# BathtubPlant the NN needs weights in [-0.1, 0.1]
# CounrnotPlant needs num_layers=0
# CarVelocityPlant has to have weight range in [-0.1, 0.1], [-0.01, 0.01] does not work

#Good examples
# - BathtubPlant: num_layers=2, num_neurons=32, weights[-0.01, 0.01], seed=2
# - CournotPlant: num_layers=1, num_neurons=32, weights[-0.01, 0.01], seed=10 - weights[-0.1, 0.1] might be better
#   - Does not work when seed=2
